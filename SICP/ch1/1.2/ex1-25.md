# Exercise 1.25

[Exercise 1.25 solution](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-1.25)

> The modified version of expmod computes huge intermediate results.
>
> Scheme is able to handle arbitrary-precision arithmetic, but arithmetic with arbitrarily long numbers is computationally expensive. This means that we get the same (correct) results, but it takes considerably longer.
>
> The remainder operation inside the original expmod implementation, keeps the numbers being squared less than the number tested for primality m. fast-expt however squares huge numbers of a^m size.
